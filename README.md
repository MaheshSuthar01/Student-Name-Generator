# Student-Name-Generator

•	Developed a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter and Dart to generate random student full names from a predefined list. 

•	Focused on clean UI/UX using Material Design principles and responsive layouts for a smooth user experience. Implemented a “Generate” button that displays a random student name while preventing duplicates by storing used names with Shared Preferences for persistent local storage.
